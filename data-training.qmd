## Training sessions

Similar to SADs, when raters are exposed to a fixed number of reference diagrams to correct and improve accuracy of their visual estimates of severity, if raters are exposed several times to diagrams (or actual images) with known severity values, of varying values, they will also get similar benefits.

## Software

Training sessions have been used in the past and proven to improve rater's performance. Research on this topic began during the mid-1980s with the arrival of personal computers, which were used to develop computerized images of specific and measured disease severity. Those software, running on DOS or Windows system, included AREAGRAM, DISTRAIN, DISEASE.PRO, ESTIMATE, SEVERITY.PRO and COMBRO (See review by @bock2021a ). Although training has proven successful, a potential issue with computer training is that the benefits may be short-lived with raters requiring regular re-training.

### Online training tools

In Brazil, the "Sistema de treinamento de acuidade visual" was initially developed as a web-based system to train raters in assessing citrus canker. The system has evolved over time and now has a current version that is accessible on both iOS and Android platforms. You can find the current version of the system at this [link](http://sitav.pga.uem.br/index.php?menu=app). This platform provides an interactive training experience to enhance the ability of raters in accurately assessing the severity of citrus canker.

In Mexico, a specific application called **Validar-PER** has been developed to train raters in visually assessing the severity of coffee leaf rust. This application utilizes diagrammatic log-based scales as a standardized approach for severity assessment. You can access the Validar-PER application online [here](http://royacafe.lanref.org.mx/ValidarPer/app/index.php). The application aims to improve the proficiency of raters in evaluating the severity of coffee leaf rust using a systematic and standardized methodology.

### Training software made with R

#### TraineR

[TraineR](https://edelponte.shinyapps.io/traineR/), developed by the author of this book, is created using R and Shiny. Its purpose is to train users in assessing disease severity, specifically expressed as the percentage area of an organ (leaf or fruit) affected by lesions.

To use the app, users can adjust parameters for organ shape, organ color, as well as lesion shape, lesion color, lesion number, and lesion size. These adjustments will generate a standard area diagram with an ellipsoidal shape.

To initiate the training, users should first set the desired number of attempts for the session and click on the "generate new" button. A diagram will then be displayed, and users should input their estimate of the diseased area as a numeric value in percentage. The estimate will be recorded and shown in a table along with the actual value, enabling a comparison between the actual and estimated values.

Users can continue generating new diagrams and providing estimates until they reach the defined number of attempts. Once the final attempt is completed, the app will present the accuracy in the form of Lin's concordance correlation coefficient to the user. Plots depicting the relationship between estimates and actual values, as well as the error of the estimates, will be displayed. Furthermore, comprehensive accuracy statistics are also made available.

Currently, the app has certain limitations, including the inability to overlap lesions and a maximum severity representation of approximately 60%. Nonetheless, it remains a valuable educational and demonstration tool.

#### Trainer2

[Trainer2](https://delponte.shinyapps.io/traineR2/) the second generation of TraineR, takes advantage of actual photographs showcasing disease symptoms. This updated version allows for testing the ability of raters to assess disease severity, particularly by evaluating the percentage area affected based on real symptoms captured in the photographs.

By utilizing actual images, Trainer2 offers a more realistic and practical approach to training raters. Raters can now evaluate disease severity by visually inspecting the symptoms depicted in the photographs, enhancing their ability to accurately assess the extent of damage in terms of the affected area.

The incorporation of real symptoms in Trainer2 serves as a valuable tool for evaluating and refining the skills of raters in disease severity assessment. It provides a more authentic training experience and helps raters become proficient in identifying and quantifying the extent of disease based on visual cues observed in real-life scenarios.
