## Training software

Similar to SADs, when raters are exposed to a fixed number of reference diagrams to correct and improve accuracy of their visual estimates of severity, if raters are exposed several times to diagrams (or actual images) with known severity values, of varying values, they will also get similar benefits.

In fact, training sessions have been used in the past and proven to improve rater's performance. Research on this topic began during the mid-1980s with the arrival of personal computers, which were used to develop computerized images of specific and measured disease severity. Those software, running on DOS or Windows system, included AREAGRAM, DISTRAIN, DISEASE.PRO, ESTIMATE, SEVERITY.PRO and COMBRO (See review by @bock2021a ). Although training has proven successful, a potential issue with computer training is that the benefits may be short-lived with raters requiring regular re-training.

### Online training tools

Recently, there has been developments of training software that runs on the web or smartphones. In Brazil, a system called "Sistema de treinamento de acuidade visual" was initially developed and ran on the web to train raters in the assessment of citrus canker. [Current version](http://sitav.pga.uem.br/index.php?menu=app) runs on both iOS and Android platforms.

In Mexico, an application was developed specifically for training raters to visually assess the severity of coffee leaf rust using diagrammatic log-based scales. The system is called Validar-PER and can be found online at [here](http://royacafe.lanref.org.mx/ValidarPer/app/index.php).

### Training system made with R 

The Plant Disease [TraineR](https://edelponte.shinyapps.io/traineR/), developed by the author of this book, is an online app created using R and Shiny. Its purpose is to train users in the assessment of disease severity, which is expressed as the percent area of an organ (leaf or fruit) affected by lesions.

To utilize the app, users adjust organ shape and color parameters as well as lesion parameters, which include shape, color, number, and size of lesions. These adjustments create a standard area diagram. Users should then examine the generated diagram and provide an estimate of disease severity, based on the perceived percentage of the diseased area. After clicking "show organ severity," the app calculates the actual disease severity as the percentage of the leaf area covered by the lesions. Currently, the app has some limitations, such as the inability to overlap lesions and a maximum severity of approximately 60%. Despite these limitations, it is a valuable educational and demonstration tool.
