<img src="cover.png" style="float: right;  margin: 0 0 0 20px" width="220"> **R for Plant Disease Epidemiology** (R4PDE) is a book project in the development stage. It is based on my teaching notes of a graduate course, currently **FIP 602 - Plant Disease Epidemiology**, offered every year for students of the [Graduate Program in Plant Pathology](http://www.dfp.ufv.br/grad/) of the Universidade Federal de Vi√ßosa.

This book is for those interested in studying and modelling plant disease epidemics using R programming. Here, I provide context and showcase several methods for describing, visualizing and analyzing epidemic data collected over time and/or space. 

Users should have have a minimum knowledge of R programming using the RStudio IDE and the tidyverse ecosystem. I make use of custom functions or general and specific R packages for conducting the most common tasks related with the analysis of plant disease epidemiology data.
