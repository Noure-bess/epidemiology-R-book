# Welcome {.unnumbered}

**R for Plant Disease Epidemiology** (R4PDE) is a book project in the development stage. It is based on the teaching notes of my graduate course - FIP 602 - Plant Disease Epidemiology, offered every year for students of the [Graduate Program in Plant Pathology](http://www.dfp.ufv.br/grad/) of the Universidade Federal de Vi√ßosa.

This book is for those interested in studying and modelling plant disease epidemics using R programming. Here, I provide context and showcase several methods for describing, visualizing and analyzing epidemic data collected over time and/or space.

Users should have have a minimum knowledge of R programming. I make use of custom functions as well as several general and a few specific R packages for conducting the most common tasks related with the analysis of plant disease epidemiology data, in particular [epifitter](https://alvesks.github.io/epifitter/) and [epiphy](https://chgigot.github.io/epiphy/). In most part, I use data and try to reproduce the several analyses shown in the book *The study of Plant Disease Epidemics* [@madden2017]
