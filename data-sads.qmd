## Definitions

According to a glossary on phytopathometry [@bock2021], standard area diagram is "*a generic term for a pictorial or graphic representation (drawing or true-color photo) of selected disease severities on plants or plant parts (leaves, fruit, flowers, etc.) generally used as an aid for more accurate visual estimation (on the percentage scale) or classification (using an ordinal scale) of severity on a specimen. Standard area diagram sets, commonly abbreviated to SADs, are usually presented as a set of diagrams for interpolation using the percentage scale".*

The SADs, also known as diagrammatic scales, have long use in plant pathology, dating back to the late 1800s, when the Cobb scale was developed with five diagrams illustrating a range of severities of rust pustules on wheat leaves. Modern SADs have been designed in various color types: black or white, two-color or true-color (actual photos). Follows examples of SADs in black and white and true-color:

![SADs for loquat scab on fruit. Each number represent severity as the percent area affected [@gonzález-domínguez2014]](imgs/sad-loquat.png){#fig-sad-loquat fig-align="center" width="625"}

![SADs for soybean rust. Each number represent severity as the percent area affected [@franceschi2020]](imgs/sad-sbr.png){#fig-sad-sbr fig-align="center" width="669"}

## Best practices for SAD development

A systematic review of the literature on SADs highlighted the most important aspects related with the development and validation of the tool [@delponte2017]. A list of best practices was proposed in that review to guide future research in the area. Follows the most important aspects to be noted:

-   Sample a minimum number (e.g., n = 100) of specimens from natural epidemics representing the range of disease severity and typical symptoms observed.

-   Use reliable image analysis software to discriminate disease symptoms from healthy areas to calculate percent area affected.

-   When designing the illustrations for the SAD set, ensure that the individual diagrams are prepared realistically, whether line drawn, actual photos, or computer generated.

-   The number of diagrams should be no less than 6 and no more than 10, distributed approximately linearly, and spaced no more than 15% apart. Additional diagrams (±2) should be included between 0 and 10% severity.

-   For the validation trial, select at least 50 specimens representing the full range of actual severity and symptom patterns.

-   When selecting raters (a minimum of 15) for validation, make sure they do not have previous experience in using the SAD under evaluation.

-   Provide standard instructions on how to recognize the symptoms of the disease and how to assess severity, first without and then with the SAD.

-   Ideally repeat the assessment in time, with a 1- or 2-week interval, both without and with the aid, using the same set of raters in order to evaluate the effect of training and experience on gains in accuracy.

-   Both pre- and posttest experiment conditions should be the same to avoid any impact of distraction on accuracy of estimates during the tests.

## Designing SADs in R

The diagrams used in the set have been designed using several methods and technology, ranging from hand drawing to actual photos [@delponte2017]. There is an increasing tendency to use actual photos that are analysed digitally, using standard image analysis software, to determine the percent area affected. In this approach, a large set of images is analyzed and some images are chosen to represent the severities of the SAD.

In R, we the pliman package has a function called [`sad()`](https://tiagoolivoto.github.io/pliman/reference/sad.html) which allows producing a SADs with a pre-defined number of diagrams. Firstly, as shown in the [previous chapter](data-actual-severity.html), the set of images to be selected for the SADs needs to be analysed using the `measure_disease()` function. The leaves with the smallest and highest severity will always be in the SAD. The other severities are sampled sequentially to achieve the `n` images after severity has been ordered in an ascending order. For example, if there are 30 leaves and n is set to 3, the leaves sampled will be the 1st, 15th, and 30th with the smallest severity values.

Let's use the same set of 10 soybean leaves depicting the rust symptoms and create the `sbr` object.

```{r}
#| message: false
#| warning: false
library(pliman)
h <- image_import("imgs/sbr_h.png")
s <- image_import("imgs/sbr_s.png")
b <- image_import("imgs/sbr_b.png")

sbr <- measure_disease(
  pattern = "img",
  dir_original = "imgs/originals" ,
  dir_processed = "imgs/processed",
  save_image = TRUE,
  img_healthy = h,
  img_symptoms = s,
  img_background = b,
  show_image = FALSE,
  show_original = FALSE,
  col_background = "white", 
  verbose = FALSE
)
```

Now we can use the `sad()` function to create an SADs with five diagrams side by side.

```{r}
sad(sbr, 5, ncol = 5)
```

## Analysis of SADs validation data

To evaluate the effect of SAD on accuracy components, analyze the data, preferably using concordance analysis methods ([see specific chapter](data-accuracy.html)), to fully explore which component is affected and to gain insight into the ramification of errors. Linear regression should not be used as the sole method but it could be complementary for comparison with previous literature. Inferential methods should be used for testing hypotheses related to gain in accuracy and reliability. If parametric tests are used, make sure to check that the assumptions are not violated. Alternatively, nonparametric bootstrapping should be used when the conditions for parametric tests are not met. Reliability (intrarater or interrater) analysis should also be performed using concordance or intraclass correlation methods.
