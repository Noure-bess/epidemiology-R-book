Del Ponte](https://emersondelponte.netlify.app/) is a Professor at the [Departamento de Fitopatologia](http://www.dfp.ufv.br/graduate/faculty/), Universidade Federal de Vi√ßosa in Brazil. His academic journey includes a DSc in Plant Pathology, which I obtained from Universidade Federal de Pelotas in 2004, and a year-long visit to Cornell University in the Bergstrom Lab. Following this, he spent nearly two years as a postdoctoral associate working on a project related to disease risk assessment and prediction at the Yang Lab, Iowa State University. This experience led him to the Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, where his joined as an assistant professor of plant pathology. His peer-reviewed publications are available on various academic platforms, such as [ORCID](https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4398-409X), [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com.br/citations?user=LgNDabAAAAAJ&hl=en), and [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Emerson-Del-Ponte/research).

He is a fervent advocate for an open and reproducible research model and culture, which he believes can lead to more accessible, transparent, and reliable scientific knowledge. This belief inspired his co-founding of the [Open Plant Pathology](http://www.openplantpathology.org/) initiative alongside [Adam Sparks](http://adamhsparks.netlify.app/). In his Lab, students use the R language for all statistics and data science-related activities. All data and computational codes generated during our research are made accessible before the peer-review process. The code can be located on [GitHub](https://github.com/emdelponte). Our research findings are mostly organized and shared as a [research compendium](https://research-compendium.science/), and we archive [preprints](https://publicationethics.org/resources/discussion-documents/preprints) of manuscripts in the Open Science Framework ([OSF](https://osf.io/jb6yd)).
