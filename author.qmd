## About the author {.unnumbered}

I, Emerson M. Del Ponte, serve as a Professor at the [Departamento de Fitopatologia](http://www.dfp.ufv.br/graduate/faculty/), Universidade Federal de Vi√ßosa in Brazil. My academic journey includes a DSc in Plant Pathology, which I obtained from Universidade Federal de Pelotas in 2004, and a year-long visit to Cornell University in the Bergstrom Lab. Following this, I spent nearly two years as a postdoctoral associate working on a project related to disease risk assessment and prediction at the Yang Lab, Iowa State University. This experience led me to the Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, where I joined as an assistant professor of plant pathology. My peer-reviewed publications are available on various academic platforms, such as [ORCID](https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4398-409X), [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com.br/citations?user=LgNDabAAAAAJ&hl=en), and [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Emerson-Del-Ponte/research).

I am a fervent advocate for an open and reproducible research model and culture, which I believe can lead to more accessible, transparent, and reliable scientific knowledge. This belief inspired my co-founding of the [Open Plant Pathology](http://www.openplantpathology.org/) initiative alongside [Adam Sparks](http://adamhsparks.netlify.app/). In my Lab, students use the R language for all statistics and data science-related activities. All data and computational codes generated during our research are made accessible before the peer-review process. The code can be located on [GitHub](https://github.com/emdelponte). Our research findings are mostly organized and shared as a [research compendium](https://research-compendium.science/), and we archive [preprints](https://publicationethics.org/resources/discussion-documents/preprints) of manuscripts in the Open Science Framework ([OSF](https://osf.io/jb6yd)).
