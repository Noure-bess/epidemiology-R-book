Emerson M. Del Ponte is an Associate Professor at the [Departamento de Fitopatologia](http://www.dfp.ufv.br/graduate/faculty/), Universidade Federal de Vi√ßosa in Brazil. He holds a DSc in Plant Pathology (Universidade Federal de Pelotas, 2004) with a one-year visit to Cornell University (Bergstrom Lab). He worked during almost two years as a postdoctoral associate in a project involving disease risk assessment and prediction (Yang Lab, Iowa State University) prior to join the Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, as assistant professor of plant pathology. His peer-reviewed publications can be found in the following academic websites: [ORCID](https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4398-409X), [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com.br/citations?user=LgNDabAAAAAJ&hl=en), and [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Emerson-Del-Ponte/research).

Emerson is a strong advocate for an open and reproducible research model and culture that may ultimately contribute to a more accessible, transparent and reliable science. This led him to co-found [Open Plant Pathology](http://www.openplantpathology.org/) initiative together with [Adam Sparks](http://adamhsparks.com/). In his Lab, students make use of [R language](https://www.r-project.org/) for all statistical and data science related activities. All data and computational codes produced during the research are made available ahead of peer-review. The code can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/emdelponte). The research outcomes are organized and shared as a [research compendium](https://research-compendium.science/) and [preprints](https://publicationethics.org/resources/discussion-documents/preprints) of manuscripts are archived in Open Science Framework ([OSF](https://osf.io/jb6yd)).
