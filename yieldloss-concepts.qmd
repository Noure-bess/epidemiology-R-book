## Epidemics and crop losses

Plant disease epidemics can also be studied in regard to their potential to reduce crop yield (the measurable produce such as seed, fruit, leaves, roots or tubers) and quality (e.g. blemishes on fruit and toxins in grain) of the agricultural production. The yield of a diseased crop can be reduced because its physiology is negatively affected in a dynamic way as the crop grows (biomass increase) and develops (advances the phenological stages). The visual damages on the product (e.g. fruit, tuber), without prejudicing yield, may reduce sales. Losses can be classified as direct (on the farm) and indirect (on the society). Costs on farm that are due to reduction in quantity an quality of yield and control costs are considered primary. The build-up of inoculum in soil and reduced efficacy of control due to surge of resistance to chemicals in the pathogen population are examples of secondary losses on farm.

The famous epidemics in the ancient history, such as the late blight of potatoes, serve us as a remind of worst-case scenarios of major impact of epidemics causing both direct and indirect losses. However, crop losses due to diseases occur regularly and at levels that depend on the intensity of epidemics [@chapter2017a]. Expert opinion estimates have indicated that around 20% (on average) of the yield of major crops like wheat, rice, maize, potato and soybean is lost due to the pests and pathogens globally [@savary2019].

There are several reasons, however, that new epidemics of devastating effects may continue to occur. Recently in history, severe epidemics that reached pandemic levels have been noticed and related, for example, to the incursion of pathogens into other regions where it has not been present (see box). Differently, new pathogenic strains may emerge due to drivers of genetic diversity in the pathogen population. A recent example is the Ug99 strain of the wheat stem rust, a significant threat to global wheat production. First detected in Uganda in 1998, an asexual lineage has spread through Africa and the Middle East causing devastating epidemics. A study suggested that Ug99 arose by somatic hybridisation and nuclear exchange between isolates of different lineages [@li2019]. Finally, diseases may emerge or re-emerge due to the changes or shifts in climatic patterns. An example is Fusarium head blight of wheat caused by the fungus *Fusarium graminearum*. In Southern Brazil, the higher frequency of severe epidemics that led to increased yield loss after the early 1990s have been associated with shifts in the rainfall patterns across decades [@Duffeck2020]

## Box: Diseases on the move

In Brazil, the soybean rust pathogen (*Phakopsora pachyrhizi*) first reached southern Brazil in 2002 \[@Yorinori2005\]. The disease spread to all production regions of the country in the following few years, severely reducing yields. To overcome the problem, farmers have relied on massive applications of fungicides on soybeans, which dramatically increased the production costs with the need for sequential fungicide sprays to combat the disease. Total economic loss have been estimated at around US\$ 2 billion yearly \[@godoy2016\].

More recently, wheat blast, a disease that originated in the south of Brazil in 1984, and have been restricted to South America, was firstly spotted in South Asia, Bangladesh, in 2016. Blast epidemics in that occasion devastated more than 15,000 ha of wheat and reduced yield of wheat in the affected field up to 100% \[@malaker2016; @islam2019b\]. The disease was later found in Zambia, thus also becoming a threat to wheat production in Africa [@tembo2020].

## Assessing crop losses

According to @chapter2017a, knowledge about the disease:yield relationship falls within crop loss assessment, a general branch of epidemiology that study the relationship between the attack by harmful organisms and the resulting yield (or yield loss) of crops. In fact, the study (analysis and modeling) of crop losses is considered central to plant pathology as no plant protection scientific reasoning could be possible without a measure of crop loss [@Savary2006].

The yield loss studies are only possible when reliable field data is collected in sufficient number to allow the development of statistical models (that summarizes the relationship) as well as the validation of mechanistic simulation models. Whenever established, knowledge on the empirical disease:yield relationship and on the theoretical basis of damage on crops, can further be used for several purposes such as: 1) determine the effect of control on crop yield; 2) make prediction of yield in given location or region; and 3) determine the economic importance of diseases.

The concept of yield levels is important to recognize as a framework to study crop loss: There are three levels: theoretical, attainable and actual yield. The **theoretical** (also known as potential) yield is determined greatly by the genotype of the crop grown under ideal conditions. It is measured in experimental plots with high input of fertilizers and pesticides. The **attainable** yield is obtained in commercial crops managed with a full range of modern technology to maximize yield. It considers the presence of limiting factors such as water and fertilizers. The **actual** yield is generally less than or equal to attainable yield, and is obtained under the effect of reducing factors such as those caused by pest (disease, insects, weeds) injuries, or the a measurable symptom caused by a harmful organism. It is the crop yield actually harvested in a farmer\'s field. **Yield loss** (expressed in absolute or relative terms) is the difference between the attainable and the actual yield.
