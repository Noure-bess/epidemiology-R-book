## Introduction

Plant disease epidemics can also be studied in regard to their potential to reduce crop yield (the measurable produce such as seed, fruit, leaves, roots or tubers) and quality (e.g. blemishes on fruit and toxins in grain) of the agricultural production. The yield of some crops that host the pathogen for long time may be reduced because its physiology is negatively affected in a dynamic way as the crop grows (biomass increase) and develops (advances the phenological stages). For some diseases that primarily infect the product (e.g. grains), yield is directly as affected with the reduction in size and weight of the affected plant part. There are cases of diseases causing visual damages on the product (e.g. fruit, tuber) that do no result in yield reduction, but the presence of the symptoms may reduce sales. Another example is the presence of toxins that downgrade product value.

Losses can be classified as direct (on the farm) or indirect (on the society) (@fig-losses). Costs on farm that are due to reduction in quantity an quality of yield and control costs are classified as primary. Other consequences of the epidemics such as the build-up of inoculum in soil and the reduced efficacy of control due to surge of resistance to chemicals in the pathogen population over the years are examples of secondary losses on farm.

The famous epidemics in the ancient history, such as the late blight of potatoes, serve us as a remind of worst-case scenarios of major impact of epidemics causing both direct and indirect losses. However, crop losses due to diseases occur regularly and at levels that depend on the intensity of epidemics [@chapter2017a]. Expert opinion estimates have indicated that around 20% (on average) of the yield of major crops like wheat, rice, maize, potato and soybean is lost due to the pests and pathogens globally [@savary2019].

## Crop loss assessment

According to @chapter2017a, knowledge about the disease:yield relationship falls within crop loss assessment, a general branch of epidemiology that study the relationship between the attack by harmful organisms and the resulting yield (or yield loss) of crops. In fact, the study (analysis and modeling) of crop losses is considered central to plant pathology as no plant protection scientific reasoning could be possible without a measure of crop loss [@Savary2006].

The concept of yield levels is important to recognize as a framework to study crop losses. There are three levels (from higher to lower) of yield: theoretical, attainable and actual.

-   **Theoretical** (also known as potential) yield is determined mainly by *defining factors* such as the genotype of the crop grown under ideal conditions. It can be obtained in experimental plots managed with high input of fertilizers and pesticides.
-   **Attainable** yield is obtained in commercial crops managed with a full range of modern technology to maximize yield. It considers the presence of *limiting factors* such as water and fertilizers.
-   **Actual** yield is generally less than or equal to attainable yield, and is obtained under the effect of *reducing factors* such as those caused by pest (disease, insects, weeds) injuries - defined as measurable symptom caused by a harmful organism. It is the crop yield actually harvested in a farmer's field.

**Yield loss** (expressed in absolute or relative terms) is the difference between the attainable and the actual yield. Yield loss studies are only possible when reliable field data are collected in sufficient number to allow the development of statistical (empirical) models as well as the validation of mechanistic simulation yield loss models.

## Disease:yield data and graphs

The datasets used to characterize a disease:yield relationship should ideally have a wide range of values of yield and disease. Two different approaches have been used to obtain such data: 1) experimentation conducted in the field or greenhouse; or 2) from surveys in naturally infected commercial fields.

In experiments, the researcher rely on different treatments that will result in different epidemics - assuming that the disease affects yield. These treatments include mainly the use of inoculations of varying inoculum levels (when disease is expected to be low) and application of fungicides at varying rate, number or timing (when disease is expected to be high) Alternatively, one can use different host genotypes (preferably isolines or near isolines) with varying susceptibility or manipulate the environment (e.g. irrigation).

Whatever the case, the relationship between a measure of yield (in absolute or relative terms) and disease variable can be appraised using scatter plots that depict a "damage curve" [@chapter2017a]. The disease variable most commonly represent the assessment of disease at a single time (critical point). Sometimes, the data obtained from multiple assessments during the epidemics is used to calculate the area under the disease progress curve that is used to represent disease variable.

Let's work with actual data on the incidence of white mold disease and yield of soybean determined across different locations and years in Brazil [@lehner2016]. The variation in disease and yield was obtained by applying different fungicides that varied in efficacy, thus resulting in variable final disease incidence. The data was made freely available in this [repository](https://github.com/emdelponte/paper-white-mold-meta-analysis "link").

```{r}
#| message: false
#| warning: false

library(tidyverse)
theme_set(theme_bw(base_size = 16))
wm <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/emdelponte/paper-white-mold-meta-analysis/gh-pages/dat-white-mold-br.csv")
glimpse(wm)

```

As seen above using `glimpse()` function, the full data set has 17 variables. Let's reduce the data set to a few variables (study, inc and yld) and the trials number 1 and 2.

```{r}
wm2 <- wm |> 
  select(study, inc, yld) |> 
  filter(study %in% c(1,2)) 
wm2
```

We can now produce the damage curves for each study. As it can be seen, the relationship can be adequately described by a straight line.

```{r}
#| message: false
#| label: fig-damagecurve1
#| fig-cap: "Relationship between soybean yield and incidence of white mold in two experiments"
wm2 |> 
  ggplot(aes(inc, yld, 
             group = study, 
             color = factor(study)))+
  geom_point(size = 2)+
  ggthemes::scale_color_colorblind()+
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = F, color = "black", fullrange = T)+
  ylim(1800, 3500)+
  facet_wrap(~study)+
  labs(x = "White mold incidence (%)",
       y = "Soybean yield (kg/ha)",
       color = "Study")
```

We can plot the relationships for all studies combined, which will resemble a "spaghetti" plot after adding the individual regression lines.

```{r}
#| message: false
#| warning: false
#| label: fig-damagecurve2
#| fig-cap: "Relationship between soybean yield and incidence of white mold across trials. Observed (left) and fitted regression lines (right)"
p1 <- wm |> 
  ggplot(aes(inc, yld, group = study))+
  geom_point(size = 2, alpha = 0.5)+
  ylim(0, 5000)+
  labs(x = "White mold incidence (%)",
       y = "Soybean yield (kg/ha)")

p2 <- wm |> 
  ggplot(aes(inc, yld, group = study))+
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = F, fullrange = T, color = "black")+
  ylim(0, 5000)+
  labs(x = "White mold incidence (%)",
       y = "Soybean yield (kg/ha)")

library(patchwork)
p1 | p2
```
