## Introduction

Plant disease epidemics can also be studied in regard to their potential to reduce crop yield (the measurable produce of the crop) and quality (e.g. blemishes on fruit and toxins in grain) of the agricultural production. The yield of a diseased crop can be reduced because its physiology is negatively affected in a dynamic way as the crop grows (biomass increase) and develops (advances the phenological stages). The visual damages on the product (e.g. fruit, tuber), without prejudicing yield, may reduce the the sale price. Losses can be classified as direct (on the farm) and indirect (by the society). Costs on farm that are due to reduction in quantity an quality of yield and control costs are considered primary. Examples of secondary losses on farm include build-up of inoculum in soil or reduced efficacy of control due to resistance to chemicals.

The famous epidemics in the ancient history, such as the late blight of potatoes, serve us as a remind of worst-case scenarios of major impact of epidemics causing direct and indirect losses. However, yield losses due to diseases occur regularly and at levels that depend on the intensity of epidemics [@chapter2017a]. Expert opinion estimates have indicated that around 20% (on average) of the yield of major crops like wheat, rice, maize, potato and soybean is lost due to the pests and pathogens globally [@savary2019].

There are several reasons, however, that new epidemics of devastating effects may continue to occur. Recently in history, severe epidemics that reached pandemic levels have been noticed and related, for example, to the incursion of pathogens into other regions where it has not been present (see box). Differently, new pathogenic strains may emerge due to drivers of genetic diversity in the pathogen population. A recent example is the Ug99 strain of the wheat stem rust, a significant threat to global wheat production. First detected in Uganda in 1998, an asexual lineage has spread through Africa and the Middle East causing devastating epidemics. Recent studies has shown that Ug99 arose by somatic hybridisation and nuclear exchange between an African member of the *Pgt* 21 lineage and an unknown isolate [@li2019].

## Diseases on the move

The disease spread to all production regions of the country in the following few years, severely reducing yields. To overcome the problem, farmers have relied on massive applications of fungicides on soybeans, which dramatically increased the production costs with the need for sequential fungicide sprays to combat the disease. Total economic loss have been estimated at around US\$ 2 billion yearly [@godoy2016]. More recently, wheat blast, a disease that originated in the south of Brazil in 1984, and have been restricted to South America, was firstly spotted in South Asia, Bangladesh, in 2016. Blast epidemics in that occasion devastated more than 15,000 ha of wheat and reduced yield of wheat in the affected field up to 100% [@malaker2016; @islam2019b]. The disease was later found in Zambia, thus also becoming a threat to wheat production in Africa [@tembo2020].

## Crop loss assessment

According to @chapter2017a, knowledge about the disease:yield relationships falls within crop loss assessment, a general branch of epidemiology that study the relationship between the attack by harmful organisms and the resulting yield (or yield loss) of crops. In fact, the study of crop losses (analysis and modeling) is considered central to plant pathology as no plant protection scientific reasoning could be possible without a measure of crop loss [@Savary2006]. The yield loss studies are possible, to both develop statistical models (that summarizes the relationship) and to validate mechanistic simulation models, if reliable field data are available in sufficient number.

Whenever established, knowledge on the disease:yield relationship, can further be used for several purposes such as: 1) determine the effect of control on crop yield; 2) make prediction of yield in given location or region; and 3) determine the economic importance of diseases.
