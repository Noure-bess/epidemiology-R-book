# Introduction

When a population of a pathogen establishes and causes disease in a population of a host, the phenomenon is called epidemic. It is the manifestation of the disease at the population level. Among several definitions of epidemic, a comprehensive one is "*the change in disease intensity in a host population over time and space*" @madden2017. The study of the epidemics is called epidemiology, a well-established, active and extremely useful discipline earlier defined as the science of disease in populations.
