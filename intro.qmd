A diseased plant results from the combination of three elements: susceptible host plant, a virulent pathogen, and favorable environmental conditions - the disease triangle. However, when a pathogen population establishes and causes disease in a host population, the phenomenon is called an *epidemic*, or the disease in populations. Among several definitions of epidemic, a comprehensive one is the *change in disease intensity in a host population over time and space* [@madden2017].

Different versions of the disease triangle, by the inclusion of other elements, as points and/or dimensions, have been proposed to illustrate an epidemic [@agrios2005b]. One we prefer is the disease prism where a series of triangles sequentially stacked illustrates the development of plant disease through time [@francl2001].

Epidemics are economically important because of their potential to reduce crop yields, lower product quality, and increase control costs, depending on the level of intensity. In fact, several examples of famous epidemics, that reached pandemic levels and caused devastating effects to crops, can be found in the literature [@agrios2005b]. Regardless of the great advances in control methods, many diseases remain a challenge to manage effectively. Even though a crop or forest tree species can be infected by hundreds of pathogens worldwide, most epidemics are more or less localized and cause minor to moderate crop losses. Epidemics are often mitigated naturally, e.g., by changes in non-conducive weather conditions. In most situations, however, epidemics are contained when disease control methods are applied to keep the disease at levels that minimize crop damage and economic loss.

[![The Great Famine in Ireland (source: Wikipedia)](imgs/intro_famine.JPG){#fig-intro_famine.JPG style="float: right" width="131"}](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Famine_(Ireland))A famous example of pandemics is the Irish potato famine of 1845--1847 caused by the late blight pathogen (*Phytophthora infestans*), the cause of a disease that changed the history of Europe and the United States, and that is also known for its role in developing the science of plant pathology. During the 1840s, the disease devastated potato crops, a staple food of the Irish at the time. The disease was triggered by the introduction of a new virulent pathogen population that found the right environmental conditions (cool and wet weather) for infection and development in a highly dense population of susceptible hosts.

Botanical epidemiology, or the study of plant disease epidemics, is a relatively young discipline formally recognized in 1963. Two important facts marked that year. J.E. Vanderplank published his famous book "Plant Disease Epidemic and Control" [@plantdi1963] and the first International Epidemiology Workshop was held in Pau, France. Vanderplank is fully acknowledged as the founding father of plant disease epidemiology [@zadoks1988; @thresh1998]
