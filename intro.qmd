## Concepts

A diseased plant results from the combination of three elements: susceptible host plant, a virulent pathogen, and favorable environmental conditions - the disease triangle. However, when a pathogen population establishes and causes disease in a host population, the phenomenon is called an *epidemic*, or the disease in populations. Among several definitions of epidemic, a comprehensive one is the *change in disease intensity in a host population over time and space* [@madden2017].

Different versions of the disease triangle, by the inclusion of other elements, as points and/or dimensions, have been proposed to illustrate an epidemic [@agrios2005b]. One we prefer is the disease prism where a series of triangles sequentially stacked illustrates the development of plant disease through time [@francl2001].

## Importance

Epidemics are economically important because of their potential to reduce crop yields, lower product quality, and increase control costs, depending on the level of intensity. In fact, several examples of famous epidemics, that reached pandemic levels and caused devastating effects to crops, can be found in the literature [@agrios2005b]. Regardless of the great advances in control methods, many diseases remain a challenge to manage effectively. Even though a crop or forest tree species can be infected by hundreds of pathogens worldwide, most epidemics are more or less localized and cause minor to moderate crop losses. Epidemics are often mitigated naturally, e.g., by changes in non-conducive weather conditions. In most situations, however, epidemics are contained when disease control methods are applied to keep the disease at levels that minimize crop damage and economic loss.

During the 1840s, the disease devastated potato crops, a staple food of the Irish at the time. The disease was triggered by the introduction of a new virulent pathogen population that found the right environmental conditions (cool and wet weather) for infection and development in a highly dense population of susceptible hosts.

## History

Botanical epidemiology, or the study of plant disease epidemics, is a relatively young discipline "born" during the early 1960. However, events dated a few centuries or decades before, can be linked to epidemiology. For example, in 1728, Duhamel de Monceau published the first work in epidemiology on a disease of saffron crocus, called \'Death\' (*Rhizoctonia violacea*). In 1858, a textbook on plant diseases was published by Julius Kuhn, which included the concept of an epidemic as in the Irish late blight epidemics of 1845-46. In 1901, H.M. Ward took an ecological approach toward the study of plant diseases in his book on Disease in Plants. In 1946, GÃ¤umann wrote the first book on plant disease epidemiology.

In 1960, a chapter on "Analysis of Epidemics" by J. E. Vanderplank was published in Plant Pathology, vol. 3, edited by Horsfall and Dimond. In 1963 J.E. Vanderplank expanded on and refined his ideas in his book, "Plant Diseases: Epidemics and Control"[@plantdi1963]. Vanderplank is fully acknowledged as the founding father of plant disease epidemiology [@zadoks1988; @thresh1998]. In fact, his landmark book provided the first comprehensive treatment of the description and the quantification of plant disease epidemics, and provided a theoretical framework for epidemic analysis.

In that same year, the first International Epidemiology Workshop was held in Pau, France. This is also an important historical fact that helped to shape the new discipline.
