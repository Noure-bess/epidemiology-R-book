## Defining plant disease

Disease in plants can be defined as *any malfunctioning of host cells and tissues that results from continuous irritation by a pathogenic agent or environmental factor and leads to development of symptoms* [@agrios2005d]. When caused by pathogenic agent, the disease results from the combination of three elements: susceptible host plant, a virulent pathogen, and favorable environmental conditions - the famous disease triangle. When a pathogen population establishes and causes *disease* in a host population, the phenomenon is called an *epidemic*, or the disease in populations. Among several definitions of epidemic, a comprehensive one is the *change in disease intensity in a host population over time and space* [@madden2017].

Different versions of the disease triangle, by the inclusion of other elements (e.g. man and time), as points and/or dimensions, have been proposed to illustrate an epidemic [@agrios2005b]. One we prefer is the disease prism where a series of triangles sequentially stacked illustrates the development of plant disease through time [@francl2001].

## Importance of epidemics

Epidemics are economically important because of their potential to reduce crop yields, lower product quality, and increase control costs, depending on the level of intensity. In fact, several examples of famous epidemics, that reached pandemic levels and caused devastating effects to crops, can be found in the literature [@agrios2005b]. The most famous example of the first well-document pandemics is the Irish potato famine of 1845--1847 caused by the late blight pathogen (*Phytophthora infestans*), the cause of a disease that changed the history of Europe and the United States, and that is also known for its role in developing the science of plant pathology. During the 1840s, the disease devastated potato crops, a staple food of the Irish at the time. The disease was triggered by the introduction of a new virulent pathogen population that found the right environmental conditions (cool and wet weather) for infection and development in a highly dense population of susceptible hosts.

There are several reasons, however, that new epidemics of devastating effects may continue to occur. Recently in history, severe epidemics that reached pandemic levels have been noticed and occurred due to the incursion of pathogens into other regions where it has not been present (see Box 1). Differently, new pathogenic strains may emerge due to drivers of genetic diversity in the local pathogen population. A recent example is the Ug99 strain of the wheat stem rust, a significant threat to global wheat production. First detected in Uganda in 1998, an asexual lineage has spread through Africa and the Middle East causing devastating epidemics. A study suggested that Ug99 arose by somatic hybridization and nuclear exchange between isolates of different lineages [@li2019]. Finally, diseases may emerge or re-emerge due to the changes or shifts in climatic patterns. An example is Fusarium head blight of wheat caused by the fungus *Fusarium graminearum*. In Southern Brazil, the higher frequency of severe epidemics that led to increased yield loss after the early 1990s have been associated with shifts in the rainfall patterns across decades [@Duffeck2020]

## Box 1: Diseases on the move

In Brazil, the soybean rust pathogen (*Phakopsora pachyrhizi*) first reached southern Brazil in 2002 [@Yorinori2005]. The disease spread to all production regions of the country in the following few years, severely reducing yields. To overcome the problem, farmers have relied on massive applications of fungicides on soybeans, which dramatically increased the production costs with the need for sequential fungicide sprays to combat the disease. Total economic loss have been estimated at around US\$ 2 billion yearly [@godoy2016]. More recently, wheat blast, a disease that originated in the south of Brazil in 1984, and have been restricted to South America, was firstly spotted in South Asia, Bangladesh, in 2016. Blast epidemics in that occasion devastated more than 15,000 ha of wheat and reduced yield of wheat in the affected field up to 100% [@malaker2016; @islam2019b]. The disease was later found in Zambia, thus also becoming a threat to wheat production in Africa [@tembo2020]. In Brazil, the wheat blast disease is a current threat to expansion of wheat cultivation in the tropics[@cruz2017].

## History of Epidemiology

Botanical epidemiology, or the study of plant disease epidemics, is a relatively young discipline "born" during the early 1960. However, events dated a few centuries or decades before, can be linked to epidemiology. For example, in 1728, Duhamel de Monceau published the first work in epidemiology on a disease of saffron crocus, called 'Death' (*Rhizoctonia violacea*). In 1858, a textbook on plant diseases was published by Julius Kuhn, which included the concept of an epidemic as in the Irish late blight epidemics of 1845-46. In 1901, H.M. Ward took an ecological approach toward the study of plant diseases in his book on Disease in Plants. In 1946, GÃ¤umann wrote the first book on plant disease epidemiology.

In 1960, a chapter on "Analysis of Epidemics" by J. E. Vanderplank was published in Plant Pathology, vol. 3, edited by Horsfall and Dimond. In 1963 J.E. Vanderplank expanded on and refined his ideas in his book, "Plant Diseases: Epidemics and Control"[@plantdi1963]. Vanderplank is fully acknowledged as the founding father of plant disease epidemiology [@zadoks1988; @thresh1998]. In fact, his landmark book provided the first comprehensive treatment of the description and the quantification of plant disease epidemics, and provided a theoretical framework for epidemic analysis.

In that same year, the first International Epidemiology Workshop was held in Pau, France. This is also an important historical fact that helped to shape the new discipline.
