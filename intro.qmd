A diseased plant results from the combination of three elements: susceptible host plant, a virulent pathogen, and favorable environmental conditions. However, when a pathogen population establishes and causes disease in a host population, the phenomenon is called an *epidemic*, or the disease in populations. Among several definitions of epidemic, a comprehensive one is the *change in disease intensity in a host population over time and space* [@madden2017].

Epidemics are economically important because of their potential to reduce crop yields, lower product quality, and increase control costs, depending on the level of intensity. In fact, several examples of famous epidemics, that reached pandemic levels and caused devastating effects to crops, can be found in the literature [@agrios2005b].

[![The Great Famine in Ireland (source: Wikipedia)](imgs/intro_famine.JPG){style="float: right" width="131"}](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Famine_(Ireland))A famous example of pandemics is the Irish potato famine of 1845--1847 caused by the late blight pathogen (*Phytophthora infestans*), the cause of a disease that changed the history of Europe and the United States, and that is also known for its role in developing the science of plant pathology. During the 1840s, the disease devastated potato crops, a staple food of the Irish at the time. The disease was triggered by the introduction of a new virulent pathogen population that found the right environmental conditions (cool and wet weather) for infection and development in a highly dense population of susceptible hosts.

Botanical epidemiology, or the study of plant disease epidemics, is a relatively young discipline formally recognized in 1963. Two important facts marked that year. J.E. Vanderplank published his famous book "Plant Disease Epidemic and Control" [@plantdi1963] and the first International Epidemiology Workshop was held in Pau, France. Vanderplank is fully acknowledged as the founding father of plant disease epidemiology [@zadoks1988; @thresh1998]
