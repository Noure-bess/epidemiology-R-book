Usually, more than one test is applied for the same or different scales of interest depending on how the data are collected.\n\nThe several exploratory or inferential methods can be classified based on the spatial scale and type of data (binary, count, etc.) collected, but mainly if the spatial location of the unit is known (mapped) or not known (sampled). Following @madden2017, two major groups can be formed. The first group uses intensively mapped data for which the location \\[x,y\\] of the sampling unit is known. Examples of data include binary data (plant is infected or not infected) in planting row, point pattern (spatial arrangements of points in a 2-D space) and quadrat data (grids are superimposed on point pattern data). The second group is the sparsely sampled data in the form of count or proportion (incidence) data for which the location is not known or, if known, not taken into account in the analysis.\n\n![Classification of spatial data and methods used to study spatial patterns of plant disease based on knowledge of the location of the sampling units and nature of the data.](imgs/spatial_methods.png){#fig-spatialmethods}\n\n## Intensively mapped\n\n### Binary data\n\nIn this situation the individual plants are mapped, meaning that their relative positions to one another are known. It is the case when a census is used to map presence/absence data. The status of each unit (usually a plant) is noted as a binary variable. The plant is either diseased (D or 1) or non-diseased or healthy (H or 0). Several statistical tests can be used to detect a deviation from randomness. The most commonly used tests are runs, doublets and join count.\n\n#### Runs test\n\nA **run** is defined as a succession of *one or more* diseased (D) or healthy (H) plants, which are followed and preceded by a plant of the other disease status or no plant at all. In the example below, we can count 13 runs.\n\n![Example for the computation of the number of ordinary runs in a sequence of binary data](imgs/runs.png){#fig-runs1}\n\nThere would be few runs if there is an aggregation of diseased or healthy plants and a large number of runs for a random mixing of diseased and healthy plants.\n\nLet's create a vector of binary (0 = non-diseased; 1 = diseased) data representing a crop row with 20 plants and assign it to `y`. For plotting purposes, we make a dataframe for more complete information.\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='spatial-tests_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-1_eb5c40d4f8dda2785c548c2a842b4cbb'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse) \ntheme_set(theme_bw(base_size = 16))\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell hash='spatial-tests_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-2_67aabc95eea09add96dd952544cbf971'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ny1 <- c(1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1)\nx1 <- c(1:20) # position of each plant\nz1 <- 1\nrow1 <- data.frame(x1, y1, z1) # create a dataframe\n```\n:::\n\n\nWe can then visualize the series using ggplot and count the number of runs as 7, aided by the color used to identify a run.\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='spatial-tests_cache/html/fig-runs_0eca293db0be6efd524736e9ae647151'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nrow1 |>\n  ggplot(aes(x1, z1, label = x1, color = factor(y1))) +\n  geom_point(shape = 15, size = 7) +\n  theme_void() +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = max(z1)) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"gray70\", \"darkred\")) +\n  geom_text(vjust = 0, nudge_y = 0.5) +\n  coord_fixed() +\n  ylim(-0.5, 2.5) +\n  theme(legend.position = \"top\") +\n  labs(color = \"Status\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Sequence of diseased (1) or non-diseased (0) units (plants).

The number of expected doublets is 2.8 . P-value: 0.4497 . Alternative hypothesis: non-randomness\"\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n#### Join count\n\nIn this analysis, two adjacent plants may be classified by the type of join that links them: D-D, H-H or H-D. The orientation(s) of interest (along rows, across rows, diagonally, or a a combination o these) should be specified in the test. The number of joins of the specified type in the orientation(s) of interest is then counted. The question is whether the observed join-count is large (or small) relative to that expected for a random pattern. The join-count statistics provides a basic measure of spatial autocorrelation.\n\nIn R, we can use the `join.count()` function of the *spdep* package to perform a joint count test. First, we need to create the series of binary data from top to bottom and left to right. The data are shown in Fig. 9.13 in page 260 of the book chapter on spatial analysis [@chapter2017]. In the example, there are 5 rows and 5 columns. This will be informed later to run the test.\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='spatial-tests_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-9_10fca2339caa1be3fedbc96a5cfd54fb'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nS2 <- c(1,0,1,1,0,\n       1,1,0,0,0,\n       1,0,1,0,0,\n       1,0,0,1,0,\n       0,1,0,1,1)\n```\n:::\n\n\nVisualize the two-dimensional array:\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='spatial-tests_cache/html/fig-joincount1_01be2dc878c3054ac8995646c406a149'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Convert to raster \nmapS2 <- terra::rast(matrix(S2, 5 , 5))\n# Convert to data frame\nmapS3 <- terra::as.data.frame(mapS2, xy = TRUE)\nmapS3 |>\n  ggplot(aes(x, y, label = lyr.1, fill = factor(lyr.1))) +\n  geom_tile(color = \"white\", size = 0.5) +\n  theme_void() +\n  labs(fill = \"Status\") +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"gray70\", \"darkred\"))+\n  theme(legend.position = \"top\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Visualization of a matrix of presence or absence data representing a disease spatial pattern](spatial-tests_files/figure-html/fig-joincount1-1.png){#fig-joincount1 width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAfter loading the library, we need to generate a list of neighbors (nb) for a grid of cells. This is performed with the `cell2nb()` function by informing the number of rows and columns. The argument `rook` means shared edge, but it could be the `queen`, for shared edge or vertex. We can use the default.\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='spatial-tests_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-11_d3f4509d138c9a3d3f808cde82e439c1'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(spdep)\nnb <- cell2nb(nrow = 5,\n              ncol = 5,\n              type = \"rook\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe `joincount.test()` function runs the BB join count test for spatial autocorrelation.

The sampling units may be quadrats where the total number of plants and the number of disease plants (or number of pathogen propagules) are known. Alternatively, it could be a continuous measure of severity. The question here, similar to the previous section, is whether a plant being diseased makes it more (or less) likely that neighboring plants will be diseased. If that is the case, diseased plants are exhibiting spatial autocorrelation. The most common methods are autocorrelation (known as Moran's I), semivariance and SADIE (an alternative approach to autocorrelation.)\n\n#### Autocorrelation\n\nSpatial autocorrelation analysis provides a quantitative assessment of whether a large value of disease intensity in a sampling unit makes it more (positive autocorrelation) or less (negative auto- correlation) likely that neighboring sampling units tend to have a large value of disease intensity [@chapter2017].\n\nWe will illustrate the method by reproducing the example provided in page 264 of the chapter on spatial analysis [@chapter2017], which was extracted from table 11.3 of @Campbell1990.

This differs from spatial autocorrelation because distances are usually measured in discrete spatial lags. The semi-variance can be defined as half the variance of the differences between all possible points spaced a constant distance apart.\n\nThe semi-variance at a distance d = 0 will be zero, because there are no differences between points that are compared to themselves. However, as points are compared to increasingly distant points, the semi-variance increases. At some distance, called the *Range*, the semi-variance will become approximately equal to the variance of the whole surface itself. This is the greatest distance over which the value at a point on the surface is related to the value at another point. In fact, when the distance between two sampling units is small, the sampling units are close together and, usually, variability is low. As the distance increases, so (usually) does the variability.\n\nResults of semi-variance analysis are normally presented as a graphical plot of semi-variance against distance, which is referred to as a semi-variogram. The main characteristics of the semi-variogram of interest are the nugget, the range and the sill, and their estimations are usually based on an appropriate (non-linear) model fitted to the data points representing the semi-variogram.\n\nFor the semi-variance, we will use the `variog()` function of the *geoR* package. We need the data in the long format (x, y and z). Let's reshape the data to the long format and store it in `epi2` dataframe.\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='spatial-tests_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-42_e6979a766bcbf0d630abe24fa9862140'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nepi2 <- epi |>\n  pivot_longer(2:13,\n               names_to = \"y\",\n               values_to = \"n\") |>\n  mutate(y = as.numeric(y))\n\nhead(epi2)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 6 × 3\n      x     y     n\n  <dbl> <dbl> <dbl>\n1     1     1     2\n2     1     2     2\n3     1     3     3\n4     1     4    33\n5     1     5     4\n6     1     6     0\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell hash='spatial-tests_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-43_48a631bc3ec73d5d14de5c7b142b5594'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(geoR)\n# the coordinates are x and y and the data is the n\nv1 <- variog(coords = epi2[,1:2], data = epi2[,3])\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nvariog: computing omnidirectional variogram\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell hash='spatial-tests_cache/html/fig-semivariance_a2e448d34ba51aa62fc02ffa1871face'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nv2 <- variofit(v1, ini.cov.pars = c(1200, 12), \n               cov.model = \"exponential\", \n               fix.nugget = F)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nvariofit: covariance model used is exponential \nvariofit: weights used: npairs \nvariofit: minimisation function used: optim \n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Plotting \nplot(v1, xlim = c(0,15))\nlines(v2, lty = 1, lwd = 2)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Semivariance plot for the spatial distribution simulated epidemic](spatial-tests_files/figure-html/fig-semivariance-1.png){#fig-semivariance width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n#### SADIE\n\nSADIE (spatial analysis by distance indices) is an alternative to autocorrelation and semi-variance methods described previously, which has found use in plant pathology [@chapter2017; @xu2004; @li2011]. Similar to those methods, the spatial coordinates for the disease intensity (count of diseased individuals) or pathogen propagules values should be provided.\n\nSADIE quantifies spatial pattern by calculating the minimum total distance to regularity. That is, the distance that individuals must be moved from the starting point defined by the observed counts to the end point at which there is the same number of individuals in each sampling unit. Therefore, if the data are highly aggregated, the distance to regularity will be large, but if the data are close to regular to start with, the distance to regularity will be smaller.\n\nThe null hypothesis to test is that the observed pattern is random. SADIE calculates an index of aggregation (*Ia*). When this is equal to 1, the pattern is random. If this is greater than 1, the pattern is aggregated. Hypothesis testing is based on the randomization procedure. The null hypothesis of randomness, with an alternative hypothesis of aggregation.\n\nAn extension was made to quantify the contribution of each sampling unit count to the observed pattern. Regions with large counts are defined as patches and regions with small counts are defined as gaps. For each sampling unit, a clustering index is calculated and can be mapped.\n\nIn R, we can use the `sadie()` function of the *epiphy* package [@gigot2018]. The function computes the different indices and probabilities based on the distance to regularity for the observed spatial pattern and a specified number of random permutations of this pattern. To run the analysis, the dataframe should have only three columns: the first two must be the x and y coordinates and the third one the observations. Let's continue working with the simulated epidemic dataset named `epi2`. We can map the original data as follows:\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='spatial-tests_cache/html/fig-mapgrouped_6177b0a67a8fa85fd7217d2edf28f5d8'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nepi2 |>\n  ggplot(aes(x, y, label = n, fill = n)) +\n  geom_tile() +\n  geom_text(size = 5, color = \"white\") +\n  theme_void() +\n  coord_fixed() +\n  scale_fill_gradient(low = \"gray70\", high = \"darkred\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Spatial map for the number of diseased plants per quadrat (n = 144) in simulated epidemic](spatial-tests_files/figure-html/fig-mapgrouped-1.png){#fig-mapgrouped width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell hash='spatial-tests_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-46_1c2668aa7e91b5e984c63c8f4557c355'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(epiphy)\nsadie_epi2 <- sadie(epi2)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nComputation of Perry's indices:\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsadie_epi2\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nSpatial Analysis by Distance IndicEs (sadie)\n\nCall:\nsadie.data.frame(data = epi2)\n\nIa: 2.4622 (Pa = < 2.22e-16)\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe simple output shows the *Ia* value and associated *P*-value.

The analysis of sparsely sampled data usually involves characterizing the extent of variability in the mean level of disease intensity per sampling unit [@chapter2017]. There are two types of approaches to analyse these data in the context of spatial patterns of plant disease epidemics: 1) testing the goodness of fit to statistical probability distributions and 2) calculating indices of aggregation. These will be discussed further separated depending on the nature of the data, whether count or incidence (proportion), for which specific distributions are assumed to describe the data.\n\n### Count data\n\n#### Fit to distributions\n\nTwo statistical distributions can be adopted as reference for the description of random or aggregated patterns of disease data in the form of counts of infection within sampling units. Take the count of lesions on a leaf, or the count of diseased plants on a quadrat, as an example. If the presence of a lesion/diseased plant does not increase or decrease the chance that other lesions/diseased plants will occur, the *Poisson* distribution describes the distribution of lesions on the leaf. Otherwise, the *negative binomial* provides a better description.\n\nLet's work with the previous simulation data of 144 quadrats with a variable count of diseased plants per quadrat (in a maximum of 100). Notice that we won't consider the location of each quadrat as in the previous analyses of intensively mapped data. We only need the vector with the number of infected units per sampling unit.\n\nThe *epiphy* package provides a function called `fit_two_distr()`, which allows fitting these two distribution for count data. In this case, either randomness assumption (Poisson distributions) or aggregation assumption (negative binomial) are made, and then, a goodness-of-fit comparison of both distributions is performed using a log-likelihood ratio test. The function requires a dataframe created using the `count()` function where the number of infection units is designated as `i`. It won't work with a single vector of numbers. We create the dataframe using:\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='spatial-tests_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-50_f891b1177dc97ccceccfb9b1dc4c946b'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndata_count <- epi2 |> \n  mutate(i = n) |>  # create i vector\n  epiphy::count()   # create the map object of count class\n```\n:::\n\n\nWe can now run the function that will look fo the the vector `i`.
