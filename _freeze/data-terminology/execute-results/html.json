The study of plant disease quantification is known as *Phytopathometry*, a branch of plant pathology tasked with the science of disease measurement, but which has strong roots in epidemiology [@bock2021].\n\nHistorically, disease quantification has been performed visually, but advances in both imaging and remote sensing (without contact with the object) technologies have directly impacted the field during the last several decades. Therefore, the quantity of disease can be obtained via *estimation* (visually by human eye) or *measurement* (remote sensing technologies: RGB, MSI, HSI) [@fig-disease_measure].\n\nWhile measuring or estimating disease with digital or remote sensing tehcnology is a a more objective task, visual assessment is largely subjective and, as such, known to vary among human raters. This occurs because raters vary in their inherent abilities, training, or are more or less affected by the chosen method (e.g. scales). Disease is estimated or measured on a specimen in a population, or on a sample of specimens drawn from a population. The specimen can be a plant organ, an individual plant, a group of plants, a field or a farm, and these also dictate how terms are defined to refer to disease quantity.\n\n![Different approaches used to obtain estimates or measures of plant disease. RGB = red, green, blue; MSI = multispectral imaging; HSI = hyperspectral imaging.](imgs/disease_measure.png){#fig-disease_measure style=\"margin: 10px\" fig-align=\"center\" width=\"490\"}\n\nFinally, when developing new or improving existing disease assessment methods, it is important to assess the reliability of the assessments by different raters or instruments as well as accuracy - how close the estimations or measurements are from reference (gold standard) values. There are several methods that can be used to assess reliability, precision and accuracy of estimates or measures (see [definitions](data-accuracy.html)). The choice of the methods to use depends on the objective of the work, but largely on the type or nature of the data, as it will be discussed further.\n\n## Disease variables\n\nA general term used to refer to the quantity of disease expressed by any means is **disease intensity**. This term has little or no practical value as it only suggest that the disease is more or less \"intense\". We need specific terms to refer to disease quantity and standardize methodology. A primary task in disease assessment is to classify each specimen, usually in a sample or in the population, as diseased or not diseased. This binary (yes/no or 1/0) assessment may be sufficient to express disease intensity if the goal is to obtain, for example, the number or proportion of diseased specimens in a sample or a population of specimens.\n\nThe above leads to two terms: disease **incidence** and **prevalence**. While incidence is commonly used to refer to the proportion or number (count) of plants (or their organs) as the observational units at the field scale or below, prevalence is used when referring to the proportion or number of fields or farms with diseased plants in a large production area or region [@nutter2006] @fig-prevalence_incidence. Hence, prevalence is equivalent to incidence, only differing in the spatial scale of the sampling unit.\n\n![Schematic representation of how prevalence and incidence of plant diseases are calculated depending on the spatial scale of the assessment](imgs/prevalence_incidence.png){#fig-prevalence_incidence style=\"margin: 15px\" fig-align=\"center\" width=\"480\"}\n\nIn many cases we need to ascertain the *degree to which a specimen is diseased*, which is a definition of disease **severity**. Elsewhere, severity is defined restrictively as the proportion of the unit that is symptomatic [@nutter2006]. However, a broader view of severity encompasses other metrics including nominal or ordinal scores, lesion count together with percent area affected (ratio scale). Ordinal scales are divided into rank-ordered classes (see specific [section](data-ordinal.html)) defined based on either the percentage scale or descriptions of symptoms [@bock2021]. In some cases disease is expressed in terms of (average) lesion size or area, which can be considered a measure of severity. These variables represent different levels of measurements which carry low (nominal scale) to high (ratio scale) information about the disease quantity [@fig-severity].\n\n![Scales and associated levels of measurement used to describe severity of plant diseases](imgs/severity.png){#fig-severity fig-align=\"center\" style=\"margin: 15px\" width=\"511\"}\n\n## Data types\n\nThe data used to express disease as incidence or any kind of severity measures vary in their nature as they can be discrete or continuous.\n\n-   **Discrete** variables are countable (involve integers) at a finite amount of time. That is, only a limited number of values (nominal or ordinal) is possible and these cannot be subdivided into parts. For example, a plant or plant part can be either disease or not diseased (nominal data). One can't count 1.5 diseased plants. Also, a plant classified as diseased may exhibit a certain number of lesions (count data) or be classified into a specific class of severity (ordinal data, common in ordinal scales, e.g., 1-9). Disease data in the form of counts usually relate to the number of infections per sampling units. Most commonly, counts refer to the pathogen population that is assessed, such as number of airborne or soilborne propagules.\n\n-   **Continuous** variables, different from discrete, can be measured on a scale and can have any numeric value between two numbers. For example, the size of a lesion on a plant can be measured at a very precise scale (cm or mm). An estimate of severity in percent scale (% diseased area) can take any value between non zero and 100%. Although discrete at the individual level, incidence at the sample level can be treated as continuous, as it can take any value in proportion or percentage.\n\nThe disease variables can also be described by a statistical distribution, which are models that give the probability that a particular value (or a range of values) will be drawn from a specific distribution. Knowledge about statistical or mathematical distributions constitute an important step to improve our understanding of data-collection methods, designs of experiments and data analysis such as data summarization or hypothesis testing.\n\n## Statistical distributions and simulation\n\n### Binomial distribution\n\nFor incidence (and prevalence), the data is binary at the individual level, as there are only two possible outcomes in a *trial*: the plant or plant part is disease or not diseased. The statistical distribution that best describe the incidence data at the individual level is the *binomial distribution*.\n\nLet's simulate the binomial outcomes for a range of probabilities in a sample of 100 units, using the `rbinom()` function in R. For a single trial (e.g., status of plants in a single plant row), the `size` argument is set to 1.\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='data-terminology_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-1_7dba97a5d10f90947b8afbfa44c78f5b'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\ntheme_set(theme_bw(base_size = 14)) # set global theme\n\nset.seed(123) # for reproducibility\nP.1 <- rbinom(100, size = 1, prob = 0.1)\nP.3 <- rbinom(100, size = 1, prob = 0.3)\nP.7 <- rbinom(100, size = 1, prob = 0.7)\nP.9 <- rbinom(100, size = 1, prob = 0.9)\nbinomial_data <- data.frame(P.1, P.3, P.7, P.9)\n```\n:::\n\n\nWe can then visualize the plots.\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='data-terminology_cache/html/fig-binomial_fba454345a5782ca1cd2a97280937294'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nbinomial_data |>\n  pivot_longer(1:4, names_to = \"P\",\n               values_to = \"value\") |>\n  ggplot(aes(value)) +\n  geom_histogram(fill = \"darkorange\",\n                 bins = 10) +\n  facet_wrap( ~ P) \n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Binomial distribution to describe binary data](data-terminology_files/figure-html/fig-binomial-1.png){#fig-binomial width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Beta distribution\n\nDisease incidence (or prevalence) at the sample or population level can be expressed as proportion of diseased individuals. The same applies to disease severity when expressed as proportion of the organ area affected (a ratio variable). For such cases, the beta distribution, which is bounded between 0 and 1, provides a good description. Let's simulate some data using the `rbeta()` function.\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='data-terminology_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-3_9db60be0422b82ca9c7568ba1e072aa7'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nbeta1.5 <- rbeta(n = 1000, shape1 = 1, shape2 = 5)\nbeta5.5 <- rbeta(n = 1000, shape1 = 5, shape2 = 5)\nbeta_data <- data.frame(beta1.5, beta5.5)\n```\n:::\n\n\nNotice that there are two shape parameters in the beta distribution: `shape1` and `shape2` to be defined. This makes the distribution very flexible and with different potential shapes as we can see below.\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='data-terminology_cache/html/fig-beta_efd66242bdc1074a734b6b70ef97890c'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\ntheme_set(theme_bw(base_size = 14)) # set global theme\n\nbeta_data |>\n  pivot_longer(1:2, names_to = \"P\",\n               values_to = \"value\") |>\n  ggplot(aes(value)) +\n  geom_histogram(fill = \"darkorange\",\n                 color = \"white\",\n                 bins = 15) +\n  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0, 1)) +\n  facet_wrap( ~ P) \n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Binomial distribution to describe proportion data](data-terminology_files/figure-html/fig-beta-1.png){#fig-beta width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Poisson distribution\n\nThe number of diseased plants, plant parts or individual symptoms (lesions) are discrete variables (integers) which cannot take negative values. These can be described by a Poisson distribution, a discrete distribution that counts the number of events in a Poisson process. In R, we can used the `rpois()` function to obtain 100 random observations following a Poisson distribution. For such, we need to inform the number of observation (n = 100) and `lambda`, the vector of means.\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='data-terminology_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-5_047a12494b123c765a4d01111119e69c'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npoisson5 <- rpois(100, lambda = 10)\npoisson35 <- rpois(100, lambda = 35)\npoisson_data <- data.frame(poisson5, poisson35)\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell hash='data-terminology_cache/html/fig-poisson_b18c8caf3ab9c3607f62da89b0eed15f'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npoisson_data |>\n  pivot_longer(1:2, names_to = \"P\",\n               values_to = \"value\") |>\n  ggplot(aes(value)) +\n  geom_histogram(fill = \"darkorange\",\n                 color = \"white\",\n                 bins = 15) +\n  facet_wrap( ~ P) \n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Binomial distribution to describe count data](data-terminology_files/figure-html/fig-poisson-1.png){#fig-poisson width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Gamma distribution\n\nWhen working with a continuous variables, such as lesion size, these random variables are usually described by the normal distribution. However, the problem is that the normal (Gaussian) distribution includes negative values, an unrealistic situation. Therefore, we can use the gamma distribution, which cannot take negative values, to simulate continuous plant disease data. We can use the `rgamma()` function that requires the number of samples (n = 100 in our case) and the `shape`, or the mean value.\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='data-terminology_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-7_a0ee450acf3ce2c5688042e6f2f36818'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngamma10 <- rgamma(n = 100, shape = 10, scale = 1)\ngamma35 <- rgamma(n = 100, shape = 35, scale = 1)\ngamma_data <- data.frame(gamma10, gamma35)\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell hash='data-terminology_cache/html/fig-gamma_9d82d5a379b85cdf418a949fd0e98e1c'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngamma_data |>\n  pivot_longer(1:2, names_to = \"P\",\n               values_to = \"value\") |>\n  ggplot(aes(value)) +\n  geom_histogram(fill = \"darkorange\",\n                 color = \"white\",\n                 bins = 15) +\n  ylim(0, max(gamma_data$gamma35)) +\n  facet_wrap( ~ P) \n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Gamma distribution to describe continuous data](data-terminology_files/figure-html/fig-gamma-1.png){#fig-gamma width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Simulating ordinal data\n\nFor ordinal data, such as a limited number of ranked-values in an ordinal scale (e.g. 0 to 5) we can use the `sample()` function and define the probability associated with each rank. Let's generate 30 units with a distinct ordinal score. In the first situation, the higher probabilities (0.5) are for scores 4 and 5 and lower (0.1) for scores 0 and 1, and in the second situation is the converse.\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='data-terminology_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-9_fbd2c0e71fd9e844cb53000d63cb7afa'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nordinal1 <- sample(0:5, 30, replace = TRUE, prob = c(0.1, 0.1, 0.2, 0.2, 0.5, 0.5))\nordinal2 <- sample(0:5, 30, replace = TRUE, prob = c(0.5, 0.5, 0.2, 0.2, 0.1, 0.1))\nordinal_data <- data.frame(ordinal1, ordinal2)\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell hash='data-terminology_cache/html/fig-ordinal_fcf88b5fb74f12e45c4143a47ad46ae5'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nordinal_data |>\n  pivot_longer(1:2, names_to = \"P\",\n               values_to = \"value\") |>\n  ggplot(aes(value)) +\n  geom_histogram(fill = \"darkorange\",\n                 color = \"white\",\n                 bins = 6) +\n  facet_wrap( ~ P) \n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Sampling of ordinal data](data-terminology_files/figure-html/fig-ordinal-1.png){#fig-ordinal width=672}\n:::\n:::\n",
