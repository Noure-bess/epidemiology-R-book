The study of plant disease quantification, termed Phytopathometry, is a subdivision of plant pathology concerned with the science of disease measurement. It has strong ties to the field of epidemiology [@bock2021].\n\nTraditionally, disease quantification has been executed through visual evaluation. However, the past few decades have witnessed significant advancements in imaging and remote sensing technologies (which don't necessitate contact with the object), leaving a profound impact on this field. As such, disease quantity can now be gauged through estimation (visually, by the human eye) or measurement (through remote sensing technologies such as RGB, MSI, and HSI) [@fig-disease_measure].\n\nWhile the utilization of digital or remote sensing technology for disease measurement or estimation provides a more objective approach, visual assessment is largely subjective. It is known to vary among human raters, as these raters differ in their innate abilities, training, and how they are influenced by the chosen method (e.g., scales). Disease is estimated or measured on a specimen within a population, or on a sample of specimens drawn from that population. The specimen in question can be a plant organ, an individual plant, a group of plants, a field, or a farm. The specific specimen type also determines the terminology used to describe disease quantity.\n\n![Different approaches used to obtain estimates or measures of plant disease.

Several methods are available for assessing the reliability, precision, and accuracy of these estimates or measurements (see [definitions](data-accuracy.html)). The choice of methods depends on the objective of the work, but largely on the type or nature of the data. These considerations will be further discussed.\n\n## Disease variables\n\nA common term used to reference the quantity of disease, irrespective of how it is expressed, is 'disease intensity'. This term, however, has minimal practical value as it only implies that the disease is more or less \"intense\". We require more specific terminology to standardize the reference to disease quantity and methodology. One of the primary tasks in disease assessment is classifying each specimen, often in a sample or within a population, as diseased or not diseased. This binary (yes/no or 1/0) evaluation may sufficiently express disease intensity if the goal is to ascertain the number or proportion of diseased specimens in a sample or a population.\n\nThis discussion brings us to two terms: disease incidence and prevalence. Incidence is typically used to denote the proportion or number (count) of plants (or their organs) deemed as observational units at the field scale or below. On the other hand, prevalence refers to the proportion or number of fields or farms with diseased plants within a larger production area or region [@nutter2006] @fig-prevalence_incidence. Therefore, prevalence is analogous to incidence, with the only difference being the spatial scale of the sampling unit.\n\n![Schematic representation of how prevalence and incidence of plant diseases are calculated depending on the spatial scale of the assessment](imgs/prevalence_incidence.png){#fig-prevalence_incidence style=\"margin: 15px\" fig-align=\"center\" width=\"480\"}\n\nIn many instances, it's necessary to determine the degree to which a specimen is diseased, a concept defined as disease severity. In certain contexts, severity is narrowly defined as the proportion of the unit that exhibits symptoms [@nutter2006]. However, a more expansive view of severity includes additional metrics such as nominal or ordinal scores, lesion count, and percent area affected (ratio scale). Ordinal scales are broken down into rank-ordered classes (see specific [section](data-ordinal.html)), defined based on either a percentage scale or descriptions of symptoms [@bock2021]. Occasionally, disease is expressed in terms of (average) lesion size or area, which could be regarded as a measure of severity. These variables represent different levels of measurements that provide varying degrees of information about the disease quantity - from low (nominal scale) to high (ratio scale) [@fig-severity].\n\n![Scales and associated levels of measurement used to describe severity of plant diseases](imgs/severity.png){#fig-severity fig-align=\"center\" style=\"margin: 15px\" width=\"511\"}\n\n## Data types\n\nThe data used to express disease as incidence or any form of severity measurements can be discrete or continuous in nature.\n\nDiscrete variables are countable (involving integers) at a particular point in time. In other words, only a finite number of values (nominal or ordinal) is possible, and these cannot be subdivided. For instance, a plant or plant part can be either diseased or not diseased (nominal data). It's not possible to count 1.5 diseased plants. Furthermore, a plant classified as diseased may exhibit a certain number of lesions (count data), or be categorized into a specific severity class (ordinal data, common in ordinal scales, e.g., 1-9). Disease data in the form of counts often relates to the number of infections per sampling units. Most commonly, these counts refer to the assessed pathogen population, such as the number of airborne or soilborne propagules.\n\nIn contrast to discrete variables, continuous variables can be measured on a scale and can assume any numeric value between two points. For example, the size of a lesion on a plant can be measured at a very precise scale (cm or mm). An estimate of severity on a percent scale (% diseased area) can take any value between non-zero and 100%. Although incidence at the individual level is discrete, at the sample level it can be treated as continuous, as it can assume any value in proportion or percentage.\n\nDisease variables can also be characterized by a statistical distribution, which are models that provide the probability of a specific value (or a range of values) being drawn from a particular distribution. Understanding statistical or mathematical distributions is a crucial step in improving our grasp of data collection methods, experiment design, and data analysis processes such as data summarization or hypothesis testing.\n\n## Statistical distributions and simulation\n\n### Binomial distribution\n\nFor incidence (and prevalence), the data is binary at the individual level, as there are only two possible outcomes in a *trial*: the plant or plant part is disease or not diseased. The statistical distribution that best describe the incidence data at the individual level is the *binomial distribution*.\n\nLet's simulate the binomial outcomes for a range of probabilities in a sample of 100 units, using the `rbinom()` function in R. For a single trial (e.g., status of plants in a single plant row), the `size` argument is set to 1.\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='data-terminology_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-1_7dba97a5d10f90947b8afbfa44c78f5b'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\ntheme_set(theme_bw(base_size = 14)) # set global theme\n\nset.seed(123) # for reproducibility\nP.1 <- rbinom(100, size = 1, prob = 0.1)\nP.3 <- rbinom(100, size = 1, prob = 0.3)\nP.7 <- rbinom(100, size = 1, prob = 0.7)\nP.9 <- rbinom(100, size = 1, prob = 0.9)\nbinomial_data <- data.frame(P.1, P.3, P.7, P.9)\n```\n:::\n\n\nWe can then visualize the plots.\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='data-terminology_cache/html/fig-binomial_fba454345a5782ca1cd2a97280937294'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nbinomial_data |>\n  pivot_longer(1:4, names_to = \"P\",\n               values_to = \"value\") |>\n  ggplot(aes(value)) +\n  geom_histogram(fill = \"darkorange\",\n                 bins = 10) +\n  facet_wrap( ~ P) \n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Binomial distribution to describe binary data](data-terminology_files/figure-html/fig-binomial-1.png){#fig-binomial width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Beta distribution\n\nDisease incidence (or prevalence) at the sample or population level can be expressed as proportion of diseased individuals. The same applies to disease severity when expressed as proportion of the organ area affected (a ratio variable). For such cases, the beta distribution, which is bounded between 0 and 1, provides a good description. Let's simulate some data using the `rbeta()` function.\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='data-terminology_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-3_9db60be0422b82ca9c7568ba1e072aa7'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nbeta1.5 <- rbeta(n = 1000, shape1 = 1, shape2 = 5)\nbeta5.5 <- rbeta(n = 1000, shape1 = 5, shape2 = 5)\nbeta_data <- data.frame(beta1.5, beta5.5)\n```\n:::\n\n\nNotice that there are two shape parameters in the beta distribution: `shape1` and `shape2` to be defined. This makes the distribution very flexible and with different potential shapes as we can see below.\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='data-terminology_cache/html/fig-beta_efd66242bdc1074a734b6b70ef97890c'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\ntheme_set(theme_bw(base_size = 14)) # set global theme\n\nbeta_data |>\n  pivot_longer(1:2, names_to = \"P\",\n               values_to = \"value\") |>\n  ggplot(aes(value)) +\n  geom_histogram(fill = \"darkorange\",\n                 color = \"white\",\n                 bins = 15) +\n  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0, 1)) +\n  facet_wrap( ~ P) \n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Binomial distribution to describe proportion data](data-terminology_files/figure-html/fig-beta-1.png){#fig-beta width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Poisson distribution\n\nThe number of diseased plants, plant parts or individual symptoms (lesions) are discrete variables (integers) which cannot take negative values. These can be described by a Poisson distribution, a discrete distribution that counts the number of events in a Poisson process. In R, we can used the `rpois()` function to obtain 100 random observations following a Poisson distribution. For such, we need to inform the number of observation (n = 100) and `lambda`, the vector of means.\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='data-terminology_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-5_047a12494b123c765a4d01111119e69c'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npoisson5 <- rpois(100, lambda = 10)\npoisson35 <- rpois(100, lambda = 35)\npoisson_data <- data.frame(poisson5, poisson35)\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell hash='data-terminology_cache/html/fig-poisson_b18c8caf3ab9c3607f62da89b0eed15f'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npoisson_data |>\n  pivot_longer(1:2, names_to = \"P\",\n               values_to = \"value\") |>\n  ggplot(aes(value)) +\n  geom_histogram(fill = \"darkorange\",\n                 color = \"white\",\n                 bins = 15) +\n  facet_wrap( ~ P) \n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Binomial distribution to describe count data](data-terminology_files/figure-html/fig-poisson-1.png){#fig-poisson width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Gamma distribution\n\nWhen working with a continuous variables, such as lesion size, these random variables are usually described by the normal distribution. However, the problem is that the normal (Gaussian) distribution includes negative values, an unrealistic situation. Therefore, we can use the gamma distribution, which cannot take negative values, to simulate continuous plant disease data. We can use the `rgamma()` function that requires the number of samples (n = 100 in our case) and the `shape`, or the mean value.\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='data-terminology_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-7_a0ee450acf3ce2c5688042e6f2f36818'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngamma10 <- rgamma(n = 100, shape = 10, scale = 1)\ngamma35 <- rgamma(n = 100, shape = 35, scale = 1)\ngamma_data <- data.frame(gamma10, gamma35)\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell hash='data-terminology_cache/html/fig-gamma_9d82d5a379b85cdf418a949fd0e98e1c'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngamma_data |>\n  pivot_longer(1:2, names_to = \"P\",\n               values_to = \"value\") |>\n  ggplot(aes(value)) +\n  geom_histogram(fill = \"darkorange\",\n                 color = \"white\",\n                 bins = 15) +\n  ylim(0, max(gamma_data$gamma35)) +\n  facet_wrap( ~ P) \n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Gamma distribution to describe continuous data](data-terminology_files/figure-html/fig-gamma-1.png){#fig-gamma width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Simulating ordinal data\n\nFor ordinal data, such as a limited number of ranked-values in an ordinal scale (e.g. 0 to 5) we can use the `sample()` function and define the probability associated with each rank. Let's generate 30 units with a distinct ordinal score. In the first situation, the higher probabilities (0.5) are for scores 4 and 5 and lower (0.1) for scores 0 and 1, and in the second situation is the converse.\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='data-terminology_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-9_fbd2c0e71fd9e844cb53000d63cb7afa'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nordinal1 <- sample(0:5, 30, replace = TRUE, prob = c(0.1, 0.1, 0.2, 0.2, 0.5, 0.5))\nordinal2 <- sample(0:5, 30, replace = TRUE, prob = c(0.5, 0.5, 0.2, 0.2, 0.1, 0.1))\nordinal_data <- data.frame(ordinal1, ordinal2)\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell hash='data-terminology_cache/html/fig-ordinal_fcf88b5fb74f12e45c4143a47ad46ae5'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nordinal_data |>\n  pivot_longer(1:2, names_to = \"P\",\n               values_to = \"value\") |>\n  ggplot(aes(value)) +\n  geom_histogram(fill = \"darkorange\",\n                 color = \"white\",\n                 bins = 6) +\n  facet_wrap( ~ P) \n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Sampling of ordinal data](data-terminology_files/figure-html/fig-ordinal-1.png){#fig-ordinal width=672}\n:::\n:::\n",
