## Introduction

The assessment of disease in space, in terms of changes in the intensity as it spreads over distance, is called **disease gradient**. In reality, it is the dispersal (migration) of the pathogen by various means (e.g. wind, vectors, rain, movement of infected material or human mediation) that promotes the spread of plant diseases within a field or across continents and generates the disease gradients. There are two kinds of gradients, the inoculum gradient where host availability is not necessarily required and the disease gradient where the three elements of the disease triangle are required. Let's see examples of actual disease gradients measured in the field with quite distinct patterns.

In the first example [@mundt1999], the objective of the authors was to measure the dispersal potential of the pathogenic bacteria *Xanthomonas oryzae* pv. *oryzae* that causes leaf blight on rice using experimental plots in the Philippines, during the wet seasons of 1994 and 1995. The data were made available [in this tutorial](https://www.apsnet.org/edcenter/disimpactmngmnt/topc/EcologyAndEpidemiologyInR/ModelingDispersalGradients/Pages/PrimaryDiseaseGradientsofBacteria.aspx). We enter the data manually and then produce two plots, one for each year.

The second gradient is of stripe rust, caused by *Puccinia striiformis* f. sp. *tritici,* on wheat collected in a field experiment at Hermiston in 2002 [@Sackett2005] and whose data was made freely available [@mikaberidze2015]. Let's enter data manually as a tibble format. There are five columns. The first and second are distances in feet and meters, respectively, from the source of infection. The other three columns are measures of stripe rust severity on replicated plots.

As it is clear in the above examples, in disease gradients, assuming that there is only a single source of inoculum, the intensity of the disease decreases more steeply within short distances of the source, and less steeply at greater distances until they reach zero or a low background level of occasional diseased plants. The shapes of the gradients are defined by mechanisms associated with the dispersal of the inoculum which depends on the biology of the pathogen but strongly to environmental factors that affect pathogen dispersal.

The resulting gradients can be classified in two types: primary or secondary. The **primary** gradient originates only from the initial focus, while the **secondary** gradient originates from the movement of inoculum produced at previously infected (due to primary gradients) plants to other plants at increasing distances from the source. It is expected that a mix of both kinds of gradients exists as the disease increases over time.

As an example of primary and secondary gradients, let's visualize the gradients of Septoria leaf spot, caused by *Septoria lycopersici*, on tomato [@parker1997]. The gradients were measured during two times, thus enabling a comparison of primary and secondary dispersal/disease gradients. More details of the study and experimental approach were provided in [this tutorial.](https://www.apsnet.org/edcenter/disimpactmngmnt/topc/EcologyAndEpidemiologyInR/ModelingDispersalGradients/Pages/PrimaryandSecondaryGradients.aspx) The data is entered below as a tribble and the plot produced using g*gplot2*.

When studying disease gradients, researchers need to make sure that there is a well-defined single source of inoculum. In gradients, this is called a **focus** (where foci are deemed the plural), from where the inoculum originates. Three types of foci can be defined: point, line or area sources. While the point source can be a plant or group of plants at any position in the plot or field (center or corner), line and area sources are usually defined as one or more rows of diseased plants at one side of the plot or field.
