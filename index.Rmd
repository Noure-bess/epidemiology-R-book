**R for Plant Disease Epidemiology** (R4PDE) is a book project in the development stage authored by [Emerson M. Del Ponte](http://emersondelponte.netlify.app).

It is based on teaching notes of a graduate course, currently \FIP 602 - Plant Disease Epidemiology, offered every year for students of the [Graduate Program in Plant Pathology](http://www.dfp.ufv.br/grad/) of the Universidade Federal de Vi√ßosa.

This book is intended for those who have a minimum knowledge of R programming using the RStudio IDE and the tidyverse ecosystem. It makes use of several general and specific R packages for conducting the most common tasks related with the analysis of plant disease epidemiology data.
