**R for Plant Disease Epidemiology** is a book project in the development stage. It is based on my teaching notes of a graduate course, currently \FIP 602 - Plant Disease Epidemiology, offered every year for students of the [Graduate Program in Plant Pathology](http://www.dfp.ufv.br/grad/) of the Universidade Federal de Vi√ßosa. 

This book is intended for those who have a minimum knowledge of R programming using the RStudio IDE and the tidyverse ecosystem. I make use of several general and specific R packages for conducting the most common tasks related with the analysis of plant disease epidemiology data.
