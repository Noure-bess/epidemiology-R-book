***Plant Disease Epidemiology in R*** is an under development book project based on the teaching notes of my graduate course, FIP 602 - Plant Disease Epidemiology, that I offered every year (started in 2017) for students of the [Graduate Program in Plant Pathology](http://www.dfp.ufv.br/grad/) of the Universidade Federal de Vi√ßosa.
