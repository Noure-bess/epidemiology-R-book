# About
This tutorial on Epidemiology using R was prepared to support several lectures I've given as Guest Lecturer in the **Plant Disease Epidemiology** course offered to students of the [Professional Masters in Plant Health](https://planthealth.upv.es/) in Sustainable Cropping Systems. The same materials have been used in my graduate course on Plant Disease Epidemiology FIP602 offered every year at the Universidade Federal de Viçosa.
