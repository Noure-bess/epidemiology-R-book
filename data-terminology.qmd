## Phytopathometry

Studies on the progress of epidemics in time or their spread in space cannot be conducted without data collected in the field - or in same cases simulated. The study of plant disease quantification is known as Phytopathometry, a branch of plant pathology tasked with the science of disease measurement, but which has strong roots in epidemiology [@bock2021].

Historically, disease quantification has been performed visually, but advances in both imaging and remote sensing (without contact with the object) technologies have directly impacted the field during the last several decades. Therefore, the quantity of disease can be obtained via **estimation** (visually by human eye) or **measurement** (remote sensing technologies: RGB, MSI, HSI) [@fig-disease_measure].

While measuring or estimating disease with digital or remote sensing tehcnology is a a more objective task, visual assessment is largely subjective and, as such, known to vary among human raters. This occurs because raters vary in their inherent abilities, training, or are more or less affected by the chosen method (e.g. scales). Disease is estimated or measured on a specimen in a population, or on a sample of specimens drawn from a population. The specimen can be a plant organ, an individual plant, a group of plants, a field or a farm, and these also dictate how terms are defined to refer to disease quantity.

Finally, when developing new or improving existing disease assessment methods, it is important to assess the reliability of the assessments by different raters or instruments as well as accuracy - how close the estimations or measurements are from reference (gold standard) values. There are several methods that can be used to assess reliability, precision and accuracy of estimates or measures (see [definitions](data-accuracy.html)). The choice of the methods to use depends on the objective of the work, but largely on the type or nature of the data, as it will be discussed further.

## Terminology

A general term used to refer to the quantity of disease expressed by any means is **disease intensity**. This term has little or no practical value as it only suggest that the disease is more or less "intense". We need specific terms to refer to disease quantity and standardize methodology. A primary task in disease assessment is to classify each specimen, usually in a sample or in the population, as diseased or not diseased. This binary (yes/no or 1/0) assessment may be sufficient to express disease intensity if the goal is to obtain, for example, the number or proportion of diseased specimens in a sample or a population of specimens.

The above leads to two terms: disease **incidence** and **prevalence**. While incidence is commonly used to refer to the proportion or number (count) of plants (or their organs) as the observational units at the field scale or below, prevalence is used when referring to the proportion or number of fields or farms with diseased plants in a large production area or region \[@nutter2006\] @fig-prevalence_incidence. Hence, prevalence is equivalent to incidence, only differing in the spatial scale of the sampling unit.

In many cases we need to ascertain the *degree to which a specimen is diseased*, which is a definition of disease **severity**. Elsewhere, severity is defined restrictively as the proportion of the unit that is symptomatic [@nutter2006]. However, a broader view of severity encompasses other metrics including nominal or ordinal scores, lesion count together with percent area affected (ratio scale). Ordinal scales are divided into rank-ordered classes (see specific [section](data-ordinal.html)) defined based on either the percentage scale or descriptions of symptoms [@bock2021]. In some cases disease is expressed in terms of (average) lesion size or area, which can be considered a measure of severity. These variables represent different levels of measurements which carry low (nominal scale) to high (ratio scale) information about the disease quantity [@fig-severity].
